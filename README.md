https://realized.me/sp24-cse110-lab3

## TODO:

### Global
- [x] External CSS stylesheet (preferred method for better code readability)
- [x] Inline CSS (helpful for debugging)
- [x] Internal CSS with `<style>` (convenient for quick experiments)

    ~~("long" and "short" refer to longhand and shorthand syntax and should give the same results. They're simply different ways to declare your style rules, use at least one of each syntax. Y**ou must use both long and short hand notations for each of the following: margin, padding, border**)~~
-   -   ~~Margin     /* spacing between html elements */~~

-   -   ~~[Borders](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Backgrounds_and_borders#borders)     /* borders around html elements, hint: apply borders before testing out padding and margin to better understand the difference between the two */~~

    -   ~~Apply these values to the display property~~

    -   ~~The layout of your page should automatically reflow when the size changes, meaning, we shouldn't have to pinch and zoom in a lot to read text, click buttons, etc.~~
-   ~~[Fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Web_fonts)       /* pick varying font styles to make your text fun to read */~~
    -   ~~Include and use a 3rd party font ([https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/)). You can load the font in either your HTML or your CSS~~

### 2. CSS Selectors
CSS selectors allow you to select the HTML element you want to style. Each type of selector targets a different identifier on your HTML element. For this lab you must use at least one of every bulleted selector method.

-   ~~Class Selector (.class)~~
-   ~~ID Selector (#id)~~
-   ~~Universal Selector (*)~~
-   ~~Element Selector (element)~~
-   ~~Attribute Selector (e.g. [attribute=foo])~~
-   ~~Pseudo-class Selector (e.g. p:hover)~~
-   ~~Selector List (element, element)  /* select multiple elements */~~
-   ~~Combinators (you must use one of each)    /* specify selections based on element positioning in the DOM tree */~~
    -   ~~Descendant Combinator (element element)~~
    -   ~~Child Combinator (element > element)~~
    -   ~~General sibling combinator (element ~ element)~~
    -   ~~Adjacent sibling combinator (element + element)~~
    -   ~~Combining Two Selectors (element.class)~~
-   ~~New Selectors /*Adopted in December 2023!*/~~
    -   ~~:has()  /*You must use this selector. Click [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has "Link") for how to use. This is a new selector that was widely adopted in 2023.*/~~
    -   Nested Selectors
        -   Nested selectors are another type of selector that have recently been adopted in 2023. [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Nesting_selector "Link") is some more information about this selector. Please also include at least one type of this selector in your CSS.

### 3. CSS Validation
Similar to Lab 2, where we validated our HTML, we can also validate our CSS. Validate your CSS through a [validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ "Link") and take a screenshot. Add this screenshot to your repo! You might notice that the validator will throw an error for some of the newer selectors you used. If this is the case, that's ok!
